Perl-Critic-Policy-CodeLayout-TabIndentSpaceAlign

Hard tabs are a perfectly fine way to indent code for accessibility and
usability purposes, allowing different users to tweak indentation settings to
suit their needs and habits. However, hard tabs should not be used for
formatting / aligning, as this makes the display dependent on the tab-to-space
ratio of the user.

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs has a setting that allows
leading tabs, but this not not fully represent the paradigm where tabs are
reserved for indenting and spaces for formatting/aligning. In particular, it
does not prevent indenting with spaces, while this module detects and prevents
it.
