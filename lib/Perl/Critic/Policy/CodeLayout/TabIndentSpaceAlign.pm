=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::TabIndentSpaceAlign - Use tabs for indenting, spaces for aligning.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0.4

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.0.4';


=head1 AFFILIATION

This is a standalone policy not part of a larger PerlCritic Policies group.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hard tabs are a perfectly fine way to indent code for accessibility and
usability purposes, allowing different users to tweak indentation settings to
suit their needs and habits. However, hard tabs should not be used for
formatting / aligning, as this makes the display dependent on the tab-to-space
ratio of the user.

C<Perl/Critic/Policy/CodeLayout/ProhibitHardTabs> has a setting that allows
leading tabs, but this not not fully represent the paradigm where tabs are
reserved for indenting and spaces for formatting/aligning. In particular, it
does not prevent indenting with spaces, while this module detects and prevents
it.

This Policy examines your source code, including POD, quotes, and HEREDOCs.
The contents of the C<__DATA__> section are not examined.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration option available for this policy.


=head1 NOTES

Beware that Perl::Critic may report the location of the string that contains the
tab, not the actual location of the tab, so you may need to do some hunting.

=cut

Readonly::Scalar my $DESCRIPTION => 'Non-leading tab.';
Readonly::Scalar my $EXPLANATION => 'Use tabs for indenting, spaces for formatting. Found a non-leading tab.';
